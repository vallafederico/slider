# Vite Boilerplate

[Deploy](fslide-0.surge.sh)

## Features

- [x] snap or not snap (toggleable) V
- [x] get speed V
- [x] get current slide and assign class (+ js events) V
- [ ] loop or non loop WIP
- [x] respond to keyboard and buttons V
- [x] parallax items w/ per item configurable parallax
- [ ] autoscroll

### Ideas

### Issues

- [ ] speed should be captured also when switching slides via button
- [ ] distinguish between click and drag and click (ie elements are links)
- [ ] issue when arrow navigating and infinite
  - [ ] better next and previous buttons

#### Embla prevent click
